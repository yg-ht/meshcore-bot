---

### `rain <location>`

Minute-level rain nowcast — tells you when precipitation is about to **start** or **stop** in the next couple hours, using Open-Meteo's 15-minutely precipitation forecast. Works worldwide with no API key.

**Aliases:** `nowcast`, `snow`

**Usage:**
```
rain [city|zipcode|lat,lon]
nowcast [city|zipcode|lat,lon]
snow [city|zipcode|lat,lon]
```

**Examples:**
```
rain
rain seattle
rain 98101
rain 47.6,-122.3
snow denver
```

**Response:** A single line describing the upcoming precipitation, for example:
- `🌧️ Rain starting in ~25min for Seattle (~45min)` — dry now, rain expected (with rough duration)
- `🌧️ Rain easing in ~20min for Seattle` — raining now, clearing soon
- `🌧️ Heavy rain steady for 2h+ in Seattle` — raining now, no break in the window
- `☀️ No rain expected in next 2h for Seattle` — dry through the window

The keyword sets which precipitation the answer leads with: `rain`/`nowcast` lead with rain (liquid amount), while `snow` leads with snowfall (reported as depth, e.g. `🌨️ Snow starting in ~40min (~1.5 in snow)`). Either keyword still mentions the other type when it's in the window, and snow/ice changeovers are called out. Bare countries or US states (e.g. `rain france`, `snow texas`) default to the region's capital with a heads-up, since one centroid isn't representative.

When no location is given, uses the sender's companion location if known, then the bot's configured location.

**Configuration:** `[Rain_Command]` — `enabled`, `window_minutes` (how far ahead to look, default 120), `precip_threshold_mm` (sensitivity, default 0.1), and optional `default_lat`/`default_lon`. Temperature/precipitation source units are shared via `[Weather]` (`weather_model` is honored).

**Note:** Falls back to hourly precipitation when a weather model doesn't provide 15-minute data for the area.

Not a single fixed command name — **`[RandomLine]`** defines trigger words that return a random line from a text file. Useful for fortunes, facts, or custom responses.

**Example config** (see `config.ini.example`):

```ini
[RandomLine]
triggers.fortune = fortune,fortunes
file.fortune = data/randomlines/fortunes.txt
prefix.fortune = 🥠
```

**Usage:** Send an exact trigger word (e.g. `fortune`) as the message or command stem.

**Options per entry:**

---

### `wc` or `worldcup`

FIFA World Cup scores and schedule. Responds **only while a World Cup (men's or women's) is actually in progress** — the active tournament is auto-detected from the ESPN schedule, so no dates need to be configured. Outside a tournament it replies that none is in progress.

**Usage:**
- `wc` - Live/most recent scores and upcoming fixtures
- `wc <nation>` - Focus on a specific nation's match

**Examples:**
```
wc
worldcup
wc argentina
```

**Response:** Current scores, match state, and upcoming fixtures for the active tournament.

**Configuration:** `[Worldcup_Command]` — `enabled`, `api_timeout`, `cache_ttl_minutes`. For proactive live match announcements posted to a channel, see the [World Cup Live Service](service-plugins.md).

---

## MeshCore Utility Commands

### `path` or `decode` or `route`

Decode and display the routing path of a message. Supports **multi-byte** hop encodings (1-, 2-, and 3-byte prefixes) when present in the path.

**Aliases:** `decode`, `route`

**Usage:**
```
path
decode
route
```

**Response:** Routing path through the mesh, including intermediate nodes. Repeater selection may use graph validation, proximity scoring, and configured presets.

**Configuration:** `[Path_Command]` — see [Path Command](path-command-config.md) for presets, graph settings, and tuning. Key option:

- **`geographic_scoring_enabled`** (default `true`) — When `false`, geographic proximity guessing is disabled for path decode. This is a **config** toggle, not a chat subcommand.

Optional **`enable_p_shortcut`** (default true) allows abbreviated path selection flows documented in the Path Command guide.

---

### `trace` and `tracer`

Run a link trace for diagnostics. **trace** sends a trace along the given path (return may not be heard by the bot). **tracer** builds a round-trip path so the bot's radio hears the return.

**Usage:**
- `trace [path]` - Trace along path (comma-separated 2-char hex, e.g. `01,7a,55`). No path = use your message's incoming path.
- `tracer [path]` - Same but path is converted to round-trip (e.g. `01,7a,55` → `01,7a,55,7a,01`) so the bot hears the response.

**Examples:**
```
trace 01,7a,55
tracer 01,7a,55
tracer
```
With no path, both use the path your message took to reach the bot (like the test command).

**Config:** `[Trace_Command]` — `enabled`, `maximum_hops`, `trace_mode` (one_byte/two_byte), `timeout_base_seconds` (default 1.0), `timeout_per_hop_seconds` (default 0.5), `trace_retry_count` (default 2 attempts), `trace_retry_delay_seconds` (default 1.0), `update_graph_one_byte`, `update_graph_two_byte`. Total wait per attempt = base + (hops × per_hop). On failure, waits then retries up to `trace_retry_count` times.

**Response:** Compact trace result: tag, hop count, SNR per hop, and optional graph update when enabled.

---

### `prefix <XX>`

Look up repeaters by two-character prefix.

**Usage:**
- `prefix <XX>` - Look up repeaters with the specified prefix
- `prefix <XX> all` - Include all repeaters (not just active ones)
- `prefix refresh` - Refresh the prefix cache
- `prefix free` or `prefix available` - Show available prefixes

**Examples:**
```
prefix 1A
prefix 2B all
prefix refresh
prefix free
```

**Response:** List of repeaters matching the prefix, including:
- Repeater name
- Status (active/inactive)
- Last seen time
- Location (if available)

---

### `stats`

Show bot usage statistics for the past 24 hours.

**Usage:**
- `stats` - Overall statistics
- `stats messages` - Message statistics
- `stats channels` - Channel statistics
- `stats paths` - Path statistics

**Examples:**
```
stats
stats messages
stats channels
stats paths
```

**Response:** Usage statistics including:
- Total messages processed
- Commands executed
- Channel activity
- Routing path information

---

### `multitest` or `mt`

Listen for 6 seconds and collect all unique paths from incoming messages.

**Usage:**
```
multitest
mt
```

**Response:** List of all unique routing paths discovered during the 6-second listening period.

## Command Syntax

### Prefix

Commands can be used with or without the `!` prefix:
- `test` or `!test` - Both work
- `wx 98101` or `!wx 98101` - Both work

### Direct Messages

Some commands work in both public channels and direct messages, while admin commands typically require direct messages for security.

### Rate Limiting

The bot implements rate limiting to prevent spam. If you send commands too quickly, you may receive a rate limit message. Wait a few seconds before trying again.

### Case Sensitivity

Most commands are case-insensitive:
- `TEST` and `test` work the same
- `WX 98101` and `wx 98101` work the same

### Getting Help

Use the `help` command to get more information:
- `help` - List all commands
- `help <command>` - Get detailed help for a specific command

---

## Additional Notes

### Location Requirements

Some commands use location data:
- **`sun` and `moon`** - Use the bot's configured default location (`bot_latitude` and `bot_longitude` in config.ini), not the user's location from their advert
- **`solar`** - Does not require location (provides global solar conditions)
- **`solarforecast`** - Requires a location parameter (location name, repeater name, coordinates, or zipcode)
- **`wx`** - Requires a zipcode parameter
- **`gwx`** - Requires a location parameter
- **`aqi`** - Requires a location parameter

### API Keys

Some commands require API keys to be configured in `config.ini`:
- `satpass` - Requires `n2yo_api_key`
- `aqi` - Requires `airnow_api_key` (optional, uses fallback if not configured)

### Weather Data

- `wx` uses NOAA API (US locations only)
- `gwx` uses Open-Meteo API (global locations)
- Both provide current conditions and forecasts

### Command Categories

Commands are organized into categories for easier discovery:
- **Basic** - Essential commands for testing and help
- **Information** - Weather, astronomy, and data queries
- **Emergency** - Emergency and safety information
- **Gaming** - Fun commands for games and random numbers
- **Entertainment** - Jokes and humorous responses
- **Sports** - Sports scores and information
- **MeshCore Utility** - Network-specific utilities
- **Admin** - Administrative commands (DM only)

---

## Admin Commands

**Note:** Admin commands are only available via Direct Message (DM) and may require ACL permissions.

### `repeater` or `repeaters` or `rp`

Manage repeater contacts and contact list capacity.

**Usage:**
```
repeater <subcommand> [options]
repeaters <subcommand> [options]
rp <subcommand> [options]
```

#### Repeater Management Subcommands

- `scan` - Scan current contacts and catalog new repeaters
- `list` - List repeater contacts (use `--all` to show purged ones)
- `locations` - Show location data status for repeaters
- `update-geo` - Update missing geolocation data (state/country) from coordinates
  - `update-geo dry-run` - Preview what would be updated without making changes
  - `update-geo <N>` - Update up to N repeaters (default: 10)
  - `update-geo dry-run <N>` - Preview updates for up to N repeaters
- `purge all` - Purge all repeaters
- `purge all force` - Force purge all repeaters (uses multiple removal methods)
- `purge <days>` - Purge repeaters older than specified days
- `purge <name>` - Purge specific repeater by name
- `restore <name>` - Restore a previously purged repeater
- `stats` - Show repeater management statistics

#### Contact List Management Subcommands

- `status` - Show contact list status and limits
- `manage` - Manage contact list to prevent hitting limits
- `manage --dry-run` - Show what management actions would be taken
- `add <name> [key]` - Add a discovered contact to contact list
- `auto-purge` - Show auto-purge status and controls
- `auto-purge trigger` - Manually trigger auto-purge
- `auto-purge enable/disable` - Enable/disable auto-purge
- `purge-status` - Show detailed purge status and recommendations
- `test-purge` - Test the improved purge system
- `discover` - Discover companion contacts
- `auto <on|off>` - Toggle manual contact addition setting
- `test` - Test meshcore-cli command functionality

**Examples:**
```
repeater scan
repeater status
repeater manage
repeater manage --dry-run
repeater add "John"
repeater discover
repeater auto-purge
repeater auto-purge trigger
repeater purge-status
repeater purge all
repeater purge 30
repeater stats
```

**Response:** Varies by subcommand. Provides information about repeater contacts, contact list capacity, and management actions.

**Note:** This system helps manage both repeater contacts and overall contact list capacity. It automatically removes stale contacts and old repeaters when approaching device limits.

**Automatic Features:**
- NEW_CONTACT events are automatically monitored
- Repeaters are automatically cataloged when discovered
- Contact list capacity is monitored in real-time
- `auto_manage_contacts = device`: Firmware auto-adds **chat (companion)** peers only, with **overwrite oldest non-favourite** when the contact table is full; the bot schedules delayed jobs to set that firmware policy and to **favourite** keys in `Admin_ACL` plus the effective announcements ACL (same rules as the announcements command), then clear **favourite** on other contacts. The bot still runs capacity management on NEW_CONTACT (near-limit `manage_contact_list`) and does **not** call `add_contact` for new companions itself. **Contact limit** for logging and capacity is taken from the radio’s `max_contacts` and, if the live table is larger (under-reported max), raised to match the mesh so counts are not shown as over-capacity. **Companion auto-purge** never runs on the radio in this mode. Count-based **repeater** auto-purge only runs if the table grows **strictly above** that synced limit (normally off while the firmware manages slots).
- `auto_manage_contacts = bot`: Bot adds new companions via `add_contact` (full NEW_CONTACT payload), runs **manage-before-add** when the list is near limit, and **retries once** after `manage_contact_list` if the radio returns `TABLE_FULL`.
- `auto_manage_contacts = false`: Manual mode - NEW_CONTACT companions are tracked in the database only; use `!repeater` commands to manage the device list.

---

### `advert`

Send a network flood advert to announce the bot's presence on the mesh network.

**Usage:**
```
advert
```

**Response:** Confirms that the advert was sent.

**Note:** 
- DM only command
- 1-hour cooldown period between uses
- Sends a flood advert to all nodes on the network

---

### `reload`

Reload supported runtime configuration without restarting the bot.

**Usage:**
```
reload
```

**Response:** Confirms reload success or reports validation/loading errors.
